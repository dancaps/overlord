# OverLord

Overlord is a python flask application.

The purpose of this project is to learn and test the following technologies.

    Terraform
        Modules
        Terraform Cloud
    Github
        Codespaces
    GCP
        Big Query
        Cloud Instances
        GCP Networking and Firewalls
    Python
    Flask

Mostly though I think this stuff is cool and it will be fun to set this up.
